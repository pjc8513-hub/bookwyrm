The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means. Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. 0aRich people 0aMarried women 0aFirst loves 0aUpper class 0aLong Island (N.Y)00655nam a2200133 a 45000010007000001000015000072450036000225200352000586500034004106500026004446500023004706500017004936510011005107890121 aKesey, Ken10aOne flew over the cuckoo's nest  aBoisterous, ribald, and ultimately shattering, Kesey's work is the seminal novel of the 1960s that has left an indelible mark on literature.
