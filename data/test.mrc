After nightfall, a Genoese ship loaded with wheat is attacked by members of two local clans who brutally kill several sailors and their captain. The attackers returned to the city, greeted by the cheers of their countrymen, and the blind eye of the authorities. The Republic of Genoa presented the Kingdom of Naples with a formal protest against the incident. But, in a historical document of great importance today, King Charles I of Anjou admitted he did not control his own city, that the true rulers of Naples were the "family." The purpose of this book is not to retrace the birth of the Camorra through the traditional roads of ethnology, anthropology, sociology, or even folklore for the umpteenth time. Amedeo Feniello takes a new route through a number of previously unstudied elements and makes a unique observation: that these "families" of Naples were in power at the time of the birth of the Angevin Kingdom of Naples-one of the first European nation states. They would have been leaders of the new state, actively participating in the business of the royal family and serving as a new class of directors, officers, and bureaucrats"--cProvided by publisher. 0aCrimezItalyzNaples (Kingdom)xHistoryyTo 1500. 0aOrganized crimexPolitical aspectszItalyzNaples (Kingdom) 0aNaples (Kingdom)xHistoryyJoanna I, 1343-1382. 0aNaples (Kingdom)xSocial conditions. 0aNaples (Kingdom)xPolitics and government.1 aShugaar, Antony.  a.b2342591xb12-17-24c11-05-24  a(2)faa(2)msa(2)nob  -  -  cmda  elfenggxxuh0i602864nam a22003135a 4500008004100000010001800041020002600059020002300085020003700108020001500145082001100160082002900171100001600200245007600216264004400292300002700336336002600363337002800389338002700417504004100444520093000485520095501415650003502370650001102405655002402416655003102440907003502471998004402506240722s2024    nyu      b    000 0 eng    a   2024031785  a9781644214237c$15.95  a1644214237c$15.95  a9781644214237q(trade paperback)  a164421423700a809.1900a809.1/9223/eng/202409211 aRuby, Ryan.10aContext collapse :ba poem containing a history of poetry /cRyan Ruby. 1aNew York :bSeven Stories Press,c2024.  axv, 220 pages ;c21 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  a"Prophet.

The collection stages an impossible encounter between Miller Oberman and his late father, who spent his last years completing a manuscript on the drowning death of his first son, Joshua. In staging this encounter, Oberman provides excerpts from his father's manuscript alongside his own poetry, allowing for the emergence and study of difficult affects such as anxiety, anger, desire, and loss. Above all, the collection sits with and interrogates the capaciousness of "trans"-ness. Oberman traces the ways that transgenerational trauma, transmitted memory, and trans identity all operate together experientially and within the nexus of Oberman's family" --cProvided by publisher. 0aAmerican poetryy21st century. 7aPoetry.2lcgft  a.b23426172b11-26-24c11-05-24  ampb  -  -  cmda  elfenggxxuh0i102283nam a22003375a 4500008004100000010001800041020002600059020002300085020003100108020002800139024001600167082001000183082002800193100002200221245005800243246003000301250002200331264004200353264001100395300002200406336002600428337002800454338002700482504004100509520011500550520114700665650003501812655001901847907003501866998004401901230130t20232023oru      b    000 p eng    a   2023003251  a9781953534880c$16.95  a1953534880c$16.95  a9781953534880q(paperback)  a1953534880q(paperback)8 a4003182147400a811.600a811/.6223/eng/202301301 aFernandes, Megan.10aI do everything I'm told :bpoems /cMegan Fernandes.3 aI do everything I am told  aFirst US edition. 1aPortland, Oregon :bTin House,c2023. 4c©2023  a90 pages ;c23 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aA TIME Best Book of 2023   "Moving. . . .irresistible. . . .Transforms verse into multiverse."--The New Yorker  a"Bristling with restlessness and wit, Megan Fernandes' I Do Everything I'm Told explores disobedience and worship, false beloveds, possessiveness, and long nights of solitude. Its poems span thousands of miles, as a masterful crown of sonnets starts in Shanghai, then flies through Brooklyn, Lisbon, Palermo, Los Angeles, Paris, Philadelphia, and finally, somewhere only language can reach, where the speaker waits for a revelation. Across four sections, poems navigate through the terrain of loss: the loss of relationships, the loss of a promised future. But amid devastation, they push us to consider joy as a necessity-in the smallest interactions, Fernandes observes that which moves us forward. "I do not track the world by beauty but joy," a speaker says. "That first bite into the soft carrot of tagine stew while a / storm wailed over the East River. The misfit raccoon / bouncing on trash bins in Central Park." Formally and sonically adventurous, I Do Everything I'm Told is the book for a generation who seeks to cross the distances between one another and rediscover an intimacy nearly taken by despair"--cProvided by publisher. 0aAmerican poetryy21st century. 7aPoetry.2lcgft  a.b23426184b11-26-24c11-05-24  ampb  -  -  cmda  elfenggxxuh0i102429nam a22003375a 4500008004100000010001800041020002600059020002300085020002900108020002600137024001600163082001000179082002800189100002600217245004600243250002900289264005400318264001100372300003900383336002600422336003300448337002800481338002700509520069300536520071701229650003501946650001201981655001901993907003502012998004402047240318t20242024mnua          000 p eng    a   2024011421  a9781644453094c$17.00  a1644453096c$17.00  a9781644453094qpaperback  a1644453096qpaperback8 a4003252582700a811.600a811/.6223/eng/202403181 aGibson, Dobby,d1970-10aHold everything :bpoems /cDobby Gibson.  aFirst Graywolf printing. 1aMinneapolis, Minnesota :bGraywolf Press,c[2024] 4c©2024  a77 pages :billustrations ;c23 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  a"In his latest collection, Dobby Gibson explores the strangeness of the everyday with fresh urgency, inviting us to reawaken and reclaim our fuller selves.

Published 70 years ago, Crockett Johnson's Harold and the Purple Crayon is a small book about big ideas--ideas about childhood, creativity, politics, psychology, art, and reality itself. In thirty brief chapters, this book explores those ideas, illuminates the creative process, and offers a primer on how picture books work.  a"How to Draw the World: Harold and the Purple Crayon and the Making of a Children's Classic presents the key concepts surrounding the children's book Harold and the Purple Crayon written by Crockett Johnson. It explores several questions regarding the nature of reality and creative expression during the Cold War. Picture books are many people's introduction to looking closely while also acting as a portable gallery that has a democratic art form. How to Draw the World also highlights the success of Johnson's book, particularly its design choices, Garamond typeface, and circulation around the world.

To make matters worse, her mom's hasty booking lands them not at a spa, but an aging dude ranch called Far Away.

Each project has been prepared for children between the ages three and six years by author Joséphine Seblon, an art historian and mother of two young children. The benefits of art for young children are well known. Art stimulates curiosity, creativity, the imagination, and well-being. But being creative with young children can be daunting. This is where Mini Artists comes in. The twenty projects in Mini Artists engage children with art through making. Mini artists will discover drip painting with Jackson Pollock, carve soap sculptures with Barbara Hepworth, and create their own obliteration room with Yayoi Kusama. They'll travel through time and explore art from different periods, from cave painting to Medieval stained glass, Chinese ink painting to washable graffiti inspired by Jean-Michel Basquiat. Grounded in art history, Mini Artists also features a range of interesting art techniques that are ideal for teaching new motor skills. Each project requires minimal setup and cleanup, so that the maximum amount of time is spent creating together. The step-by-step instructions show photographs of the projects in progress so they can be followed at a glance, and the projects use simple materials, such as clay, ink, or paint"--Publisher's description. 0aArtvJuvenile literature. 0aArtxTechniquevJuvenile literature. 0aHandicraftvJuvenile literature. 7aPatterns (Instructional works)2lcgft1 aSae-Heng, Robert.  a.b23775129b12-18-24c11-12-24  agrjamcjb  -  -  cmda  elfenggxxuh0i202122nam a22003735a 4500008004100000010001800041020002600059020002300085020003700108020001500145020003100160020001500191082001600206082003400222100001900256245005500275264005400330300005400384336002600438337002800464338002700492490002900519504005100548504004100599520056400640520024801204521003501452521003601487650005101523650003701574830003101611907003501642998007101677230804s2025    mnua   j b    001 0 eng    a   2023035682  a9781623109233c$35.70  a162310923Xc$35.70  a9781623109233q(library binding)  a162310923X  a9781644666296q(paperback)  a164466629400a745.594164900a745.594/1649223/eng/202311131 aRossow, Kayla.10aMake your own Thanksgiving crafts /cKayla Rossow. 1aMankato, Minnesota :bBlack Rabbit Books,c[2025]  a24 pages :bchiefly color illustrations ;c24 cm.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier1 aHi jinx  Holiday crafter  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aIt's turkey time!

When her own children were young, Nathan published the first version of this book, which covers nine Jewish holidays and includes step-by-step instructions for kids and their families to prepare accessible feasts. Now she updates a beloved go-to resource for her grandchildren's generation (Out with the Pot Roast! In with the Tahini Shakes!) and adds a heaping helping of new recipes. Included are dishes old and new, traditional and novel, and mouthwatering recipes that everyone will enjoy, from Moroccan Apricot Chicken and Chicken Schnitzel Tenders to Mushroom Kreplach Dumplings and Veggie Quiche. Included are essays on the history of Jewish holidays, instructions for how to celebrate them, and craft activities such as making challah covers and candlesticks. Here are also personal essays on how Nathan's family celebrates the holidays and various menus that can be mixed and matched. For young chefs, recipes also specify the ingredients, equipment, and steps suitable for children to do both by themselves or with adults. This charming book is the comprehensive guide to Jewish holidays and celebrations, and it will help make memories that will last a lifetime. Included are recipes such as: *Rainbow-Colored Challah *Bagels with Apple and Cream Cheese Spread* Shakshouka *Banana strawberry pancakes *Fruit Noodle Kugel *Pasta with Pesto and Vegetables *Potato Latkes *Apple honey cupcakes *Date Tahini Banana Milkshake"--cProvided by publisher.  aGrades 2-3bAlfred A.

When World War II ended, about one million people whom the Soviet Union claimed as their citizens were outside the borders of the USSR, mostly in the Western-occupied zones of Germany and Austria. These "displaced persons," or DPs-Russians, prewar Soviet citizens, and people from West Ukraine and the Baltic states forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1939-refused to repatriate to the Soviet Union despite its demands. Thus began one of the first big conflicts of the Cold War. In Lost Souls, Sheila Fitzpatrick draws on new archival research, including Soviet interviews with hundreds of DPs, to offer a vivid account of this crisis, from the competitive maneuverings of politicians and diplomats to the everyday lives of DPs. American enthusiasm for funding the refugee organizations taking care of DPs quickly waned after the war. It was only after DPs were redefined-from "victims of war and Nazism" to "victims of Communism"-in 1947 that a solution was found: the United States would pay for the mass resettlement of DPs in America, Australia, and other countries outside Europe. The Soviet Union protested this "theft" of its citizens. But it was a coup for the United States. The choice of DPs to live a free life in the West, and the West's welcome of them, became an important theme in America's Cold War propaganda battle with the Soviet Union. A compelling story of the early Cold War, Lost Souls is also a rare chronicle of a refugee crisis that was solved"--cProvided by publisher.  a"A history of the roughly half a million Soviet "displaced persons" post-WWII that looks at how ordinary people caught up in the deepening Cold War sought resettlement"--cProvided by publisher.20aUnited Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.20aInternational Refugee Organization. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945xRefugeeszSoviet Union. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945xForced repatriation. 0aCold War. 0aCommunism and international relations. 0aUnited StatesxForeign relationszSoviet Union. 0aSoviet UnionxForeign relationszUnited States.  a.b23776365b12-07-24c11-12-24  amsb  -  -  cmda  elfenggxxuh0i101342nam a22003615a 4500008004100000010001800041020002600059020002300085020002900108020002600137041001300163082001400176082003200190100002700222245009700249264005000346300002300396336002600419337002800445338002700473520015800500650002300658650002900681650004000710650003200750650002000782651002200802655002700824655002600851700002400877907003500901998004400936240222s2024    cau           000 1 eng    a   2024005190  a9781949641714c$23.00  a1949641716c$23.00  a9781949641714qhardcover  a1949641716qhardcover1 aenghfin00a894.5413300a894/.54133223/eng/202402221 aSaisio, Pirkko,d1949-10aLowest common denominator /cPirkko Saisio ; translated from the Finnish by Mia Spangenberg. 1aSan Francisco, CA :bTwo Lines Press,c[2024]  a270 pages ;c21 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  a"Part queer coming-of-age novel, part meditation on grief, this book is a rumination on family, desire, and finding your voice"--cProvided by publisher. 0aFamiliesvFiction. 0aFathersxDeathvFiction. 0aCommunication in familiesvFiction. 0aSexual minoritiesvFiction. 0aGriefvFiction. 0aFinlandvFiction. 7aBildungsromans.2lcgft 7aQueer fiction.2lcgft1 aSpangenberg, Mia M.  a.b23776833b12-04-24c11-12-24  ampb  -  -  cmda  elfenggxxuh0i102723nam a22003615a 4500008004100000010001800041020002600059020002300085020004700108020004400155082001000199082002800209100001600237245003200253250001900285264003200304300002300336336002600359337002800385338002700413500005300440520012900493520141300622650003502035650002802070650003302098650002702131650003802158650004102196655002802237907003502265998006102300240521s2024    nyu           000 1 eng    a   2024022630  a9781538756973c$17.99  a1538756978c$17.99  a9781538756973q(trade paperback) :c$17.99  a1538756978q(trade paperback) :c$17.9900a813.600a813/.6223/eng/202405211 aEden, Lucy.10aLove in bloom /cLucy Eden.  aFirst edition. 1aNew York :bForever,c2024.  a360 pages ;c20 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes discussion questions and an author Q&A.  a"A hardworking city woman unexpectedly inherits her grandparents' farm that comes equipped with a handsome horticulturist"--  a"In this hilarious and steamy rom-com, a hardworking city woman unexpectedly inherits her grandparents' farm that comes equipped with a handsome horticulturist. After a flat tire leads to the roughest morning of Emmaline Walter's life, she finally arrives to her estranged grandparents' will reading-fifteen minutes late. And she quickly finds out that her day is far from over: She's inherited a farm. And the Green Acres farm manager, Danesh Pednekar, is smoking hot with a deep voice that she feels in her belly-and other places that she probably shouldn't. Emma can't even keep a goldfish alive, not to mention all the houseplants she's massacred over the years. But when her big-city PR job goes bust, she has nothing to lose and might as well give the farm life a try. Over the course of her clumsy mistakes and learned lessons, she gets closer and closer to Dan. But when she comes across a locked door in the farm's giant greenhouse, she soon discovers what she thought was a struggling farm is something else entirely-a thriving medical marijuana business. And to make matters worse, the entire town is in on the secret. So when the farm-which many townsfolk lives depend on-is threatened by outside powers, Emma will need a plan and help. Can she get over that Dan was lying to her the whole time for their chance to save the farm . . . and the love growing between them?"--cProvided by publisher. 0aWomen in agriculturevFiction. 0aFarm managersvFiction. 0aMarijuana industryvFiction. 0aSmall citiesvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aInheritance and successionvFiction. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft  a.b23777114b12-05-24c11-12-24  a(2)gra(2)mpa(2)nhb  -  -  cmda  elfenggxxuh0i602116nam a22003615a 4500008004100000010001800041020002600059020002300085020003100108020002800139082000800167082001400175100001700189245004900206250003700255264003200292264001100324300002300335336002600358337002800384338002700412520024800439520080400687521002801491650002001519650002001539650003501559650002201594650002501616655002801641907003501669998005001704240701t20242024nyu    c      000 1 eng    a   2024010736  a9781665927789c$18.99  a166592778Xc$18.99  a9781665927789q(hardcover)  a166592778Xq(hardcover)00aFIC04a[Fic]2231 aAlsaid, Adi.14aThe greatest heist in Joviala /cAdi Alsaid.  aFirst Aladdin hardcover edition. 1aNew York :bAladdin,c2024. 4c©2024  a277 pages ;c23 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aCandelabra's sister is trapped in a painting, and nothing in the kingdom Nefaria has helped--but the most powerful magic object in the world is in disaster-prone Joviala, and that is where Candelabra and the other exchange students are headed.  a"Having grown up in Nefaria, a land where evil schemes abound, Candelabra is thrilled to take a school trip to Joviala, a land that's prone to natural disasters but has virtually no evil in it.

The War of 1812 has generated a significant amount of scholarly literature, overshadowing the election that took place in the early stages of the conflict. As the United States and Great Britain clashed on the battlefield, President James Madison was challenged by DeWitt Clinton, the nephew of George Clinton, who was the simultaneous mayor of New York City and the lieutenant governor of his state. Clinton was supported by a faction of Democratic-Republicans and Federalists who opposed the war, as well as by New Englanders who opposed Madison for not being more aggressive in the war and being another Southerner in the White House"--cProvided by publisher.  a"As the heir apparent to the presidency in 1808, James Madison had a substantial reputation and an impressive list of credentials, including having cofounded the Democratic-Republican party with Thomas Jefferson and serving as Jefferson's secretary of state. Despite this, Madison's presidential victory in 1808 was hardly uncontested as he faced internal opposition from supporters of James Monroe and Vice President George Clinton. In 1812, then, it was by no means a sure thing that Madison would secure a second term, and that uncertainty grew substantially after Madison essentially asked Congress for a declaration of war on June 1, 1812, mere months before the election.America's First Wartime Election focuses on an overlooked moment in political history. The War of 1812 has generated a significant amount of attention, overshadowing the election that took place in the early stages of the conflict. As the United States and Great Britain clashed on the battlefield, President James Madison was challenged by DeWitt Clinton, the nephew of George Clinton, who was the simultaneous mayor of New York City and the lieutenant governor of his state. Clinton held a base of Democratic-Republican support in New York where many in his party opposed the war. Many New Yorkers also resented Virginia's domination of the presidency going back to George Washington's tenure. Other Democratic-Republicans supported the war but faulted Madison for his poor preparations and early battlefield setbacks. United in their opposition to the war, Federalists joined forces with Clinton, but the alliance was tardy, disorganized, and awkward.The story of this election is also a tale of weak political parties. The Federalist party had steadily lost strength since the election of Jefferson in 1800, and the Democratic-Republican party was still a young, disjointed, and fractious coalition. In order to sustain the party that he had helped to start, Madison was under pressure not only to secure his reelection but also to successfully conduct the war. While Madison had vulnerabilities, given America's poor preparation for the war, the fusionist ticket supporting Clinton was poorly positioned to challenge the incumbent president. Political parties in general were still in their infancy, thus complicating efforts to build a coherent alternative to Madison. For a fusion ticket to succeed in elections, strong political parties are necessary, which was not the case in 1812. Red-hot passions over the divisive War of 1812 overlapped with a presidential election that became a referendum on the conflict itself. Momentum is important in politics-a principle that was just as important over 200 years ago as it is today.Written for scholars, students, and the public alike, Donald A. Zinman's accessible study of this important but often ignored election is another illuminating entry in the University Press of Kansas's longstanding American Presidential Elections series"--cProvided by publisher.10aMadison, James,d1751-1836.10aClinton, DeWitt,d1769-1828. 0aPresidentszUnited StatesxElectiony1812. 0aPolitical campaignszUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmenty1812-1815. 0aUnited StatesxHistoryyWar of 1812. 0aAmerican presidential elections.  a.b23788483b12-12-24c11-19-24  a(2)faa(2)msb  -  -  cmda  elfenggxxuh0i403406nam a22003375a 4500008004100000010001800041020002600059020002300085020002900108020002600137020002900163020002600192082000600218082003900224100003500263245008700298264005900385300007700444336002600521337002800547338002700575490002000602504005100622520107200673520109801745600002902843650007002872830003702942907003502979998005403014240701s2024    kyuaf    b    001 0beng    a   2024028937  a9781985901186c$70.00  a1985901188c$70.00  a9781985901186qhardcover  a1985901188qhardcover  a9781985901193qpaperback  a1985901196qpaperback00aB00a791.43023/3092aB223/eng/202407021 aBleasdale, Johnc(Film critic)14aThe magic hours :bthe films and hidden life of Terrence Malick /cJohn Bleasdale. 1aLexington :bThe University Press of Kentucky,c[2024]  axii, 263 pages, 12 unnumbered pages of plates :billustrations ;c24 cm.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier1 aScreen classics  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  a"Terrence Malick is the most enigmatic film director currently working.

It is the essential account for anyone wishing to understand Malick and his work." --cProvided by publisher.10aMalick, Terrence,d1943- 0aMotion picture producers and directorszUnited StatesvBiography. 0aScreen classics (Lexington, Ky.)  a.b23788586b12-19-24c11-19-24  a(2)hsa(2)mpb  -  -  cmda  elfenggxxuh4i401976nam a22003255a 4500008004100000010001800041020002600059020002300085020002600108020002300134082000800157082001600165100002200181245006000203250002400263260003100287300002300318336002600341337002800367338002700395520022500422520073800647650005101385650004401436650003601480650002401516651003101540907003501571998004401606100510s2010    nyu           000 f eng    a   2010019896  a9780061997792c$14.99  a006199779Xc$14.99  a9780061997792q(pbk.)  a006199779Xq(pbk.)00aFIC00a813/.542221 aMaguire, Gregory.14aThe next queen of heaven :ba novel /cGregory Maguire.  a1st Harper pbk. ed.  aNew York :bHarper,c2010.  a347 pages ;c21 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aA farcical and imaginative novel by the bestselling author of "Wicked" and "Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister" that was originally published as a limited-edition book for charity, now widely available for the first time.  a"As the new millennium approaches, the eccentric town of Thebes grows even stranger. Clocked by a Catholic statuette, Mrs. Leontina Scales begins speaking in tongues. Her daughter, Tabitha Scales, and her sons scheme to save their mother or surrender her to Jesus--whatever comes first. Meanwhile, choir director Jeremy Carr, caught between lust and ambition, fumbles his way toward Y2K. Only a modern master like Gregory Maguire can spin a tale this frantic, funny, and farcical. The ancient Sisters of the Sorrowful Mysteries join with a gay singing group. The Radical Radiants battle the Catholics. A Christmas pageant goes horribly awry. And a child is born. This is Maguire's most imaginative story yet."--Provided by publisher. 0aCity and town lifezNew York (State)vFiction. 0aEccentrics and eccentricitiesvFiction. 0aMothers and daughtersvFiction. 0aTeenagersvFiction. 0aNew York (State)vFiction.  a.b23789219b12-11-24c11-19-24  ampb  -  -  cmda  elfenggxxuh4i101695nam a22002895a 4500008004100000010001800041020002700059020002400086020002900110020002600139082001500165082002000180100002200200245011200222250002100334264005700355300004300412336002600455337002800481338002700509504005100536520063500587650003801222650006601260907003501326998004401361200514s2021    maua     b    001 0 eng    a   2023025244  a9781284286434c$169.95  a1284286436c$169.95  a9781284208542qpaperback  a1284208540qpaperback00a610.73069200a610.7306/922231 aBuppert, Carolyn.10aNurse practitioner's business practice and legal guide /cCarolyn Buppert, JD.

Did you know that plants helped shape our modern world? It may sound ridiculous, but empires have risen and fallen because of stuff you'd find in your grocery store's vegetable aisle. Through wars, famine, prosperity, and more, every aspect of our lives and livelihoods has something to do with plants! Whether or not you notice them, plants are as central to our day-to-day lives as a bowl of rice or a plate of pasta, and they have shaped our history the same way a gardener trims a topiary.

This concise introductory volume starts by offering a brief historical introduction to how psychoanalysts, from Freud onwards, have approached schizophrenia and the methods they have used to alleviate the distress it causes its sufferers. Gillian Steggles illustrates how the developing relationship between patient and analyst can positively impact the patient's mental functioning, leading to an improvement in their overall health and the ability to regain independence and self-reliance.

In his classic work, The Art of Loving, renowned psychoanalyst and social philosopher Erich Fromm explores love in all its aspects-not only romantic love, steeped in false conceptions and lofty expectations, but also brotherly love, erotic love, self-love, the love of God, and the love of parents for their children. 0aLove.1 aAnshen, Ruth Nanda. 0aWorld perspectives ;vv. 9.  a.b2379947xb12-16-24c11-25-24  amsb  -  -  cmda  elfenggxxuh4i102548nam a22003615a 4500008004100000010001800041020002600059020002300085020002900108020002600137020002900163020002600192024001600218082001300234082001800247100001900265245003500284264005600319264001100375300004600386336002600432337002800458338002700486490001500513504005100528520017400579520125400753600003202007650002802039830003002067907003502097998005402132200403t20212021enka     b    001 0 eng    a   2020016067  a9780367340124c$24.95  a0367340127c$24.95  a9780367340117qhardcover  a0367340119qhardcover  a9780367340124qpaperback  a0367340127qpaperback8 a4003039177700a150.195200a150.19/522231 aSayers, Janet.10aSigmund Freud /cJanet Sayers. 1aAbingdon, Oxon ;aNew York, NY :bRoutledge,c2021. 4c©2021  axvi, 222 pages :billustrations ;c20 cm.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier1 aThe basics  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aThis clear and accessible guide provides an essential introduction for anyone interested in Sigmund Freud, his life and ideas, and the continuing importance of his work.  a"Sigmund Freud: The Basics is an easy-to-read introduction to the life and ideas of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis and a key figure in the history of psychology. Janet Sayers provides an accessible overview of Freud's early life and work, beginning with his childhood. Her book includes the stories of his most famous patients: Dora, Little Hans, the Rat Man, Judge Schreber and the Wolf Man. It also discusses Freud's key ideas such as the Oedipus complex and psychoanalytic treatment. Sayers then covers Freud's later work, with a description of his observations about depression, trauma and the death instinct, as well as his 1923 theory of the id, ego, and superego. The book includes a glossary of key terms and concludes with examples of how psychoanalysis has been applied to the study of art, literature, film, anthropology, religion, sociology, gender politics and racism. Sigmund Freud: The Basics offers an essential introduction for students from all backgrounds seeking to understand Freud's ideas and for general readers with an interest in psychology.

The picture of Freud that emerges is very different from that of the fact-finding scientist he claimed to be. Bold conceptual innovations - repression, infantile sexuality, the Oedipus complex, narcissism, the death drive - were not discoveries made by Freud, but speculative constructs placed on clinical material to satisfy the requirements of the general theory of the mind and culture that he was building.

Freud's discoveries, including universally-influential concepts like the Oedipus Complex and the interpretation of dreams, continue to be applied in many disciplines today.  aThe book starts with Freud{u2019}s life before the discovery of psychoanalysis, spanning from 1856 to 1900, when The Interpretation of Dreams was published. The subsequent chapters are devoted to the presentation of the key notions of psychoanalysis. A chronological perspective shows how Freud's work has been constantly enriched by the successive contributions of Freud himself, as well as his successors. Freud{u2019}s contributions are also embedded in the daily, clinical practice of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. The last chapter concerns Freud{u2019}s life from 1900 to 1939, the year of his death.10aFreud, Sigmund,d1856-1939. 0aPsychoanalystsvBiography. 0aPsychoanalysisxHistory. 7aBiographies.2lcgft1 aWeller, Andrew.  a.b23799596b12-16-24c11-25-24  amsb  -  -  cmda  elfenggxxuh0i102222nam a22003375a 4500008004100000020002600041020002300067020002400090020001800114024001800132035002100150082000600171082001900177100002700196245006500223250001200288260005200300300003400352336002600386337002800412338002700440504005200467520017100519520096500690600002701655610004101682650005801723655002401781907003501805998004401840051116s2006    cau      b    000 0aeng    a9780060872632c$15.99  a0060872632c$15.99  a0060771747q(cloth)  a97800607717443 a9780060771744  a(OCoLC)12341573500aB00a283.092aB2221 aTaylor, Barbara Brown.10aLeaving church :ba memoir of faith /cBarbara Brown Taylor.  a1st ed.  a[San Francisco] :bHarperSanFrancisco,c©2006.  axiii, 234, [1] pages ;c22 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references (page 235).  aIn this moving reflection, a woman explores the tensions of her religious life--the struggle between the church she serves and her own personal relationship with God.  aAfter nine years serving on the staff of a big urban church in Atlanta, Barbara Brown Taylor arrives in rural Clarkesville, Georgia (population 1,500), following her dream to become the pastor of her own small congregation. The adjustment from city life to country dweller is something of a shock -- Taylor is one of the onlyprofessional women in the community -- but small-town life offers many of its own unique joys. Taylor has five successful years that see significant growth in the church she serves, but ultimately she finds herself experiencing "compassion fatigue" and wonders what exactly God has called her to do. She realizes that in order to keep her faith she may have to leave. Taylor describes a rich spiritual journey in which God has given her more questions than answers. As she becomes part of the flock instead of the shepherd, she describes her poignant and sincere struggle to regain her footing in the world without her defining collar.10aTaylor, Barbara Brown.20aEpiscopal ChurchxClergyvBiography. 0aAnglican CommunionzUnited StatesxClergyvBiography. 7aBiographies.2lcgft  a.b2379964xb12-16-24c11-25-24  ampb  -  -  cmda  elfenggxxuh0i101659nam a22003255a 4500008004100000010001800041020002600059020002300085020003700108020003400145082001300179082003100192100002800223245014800251250001900399264004600418264001100464300002800475336002600503337002800529338002700557504004100584520024000625520026400865650004301129650003401172700003101206907003501237998006101272240202t20242024cou      b    000 0 eng    a   2024005158  a9781645472940c$19.95  a1645472949c$19.95  a9781645472940q(trade paperback)  a1645472949q(trade paperback)00a294.392700a294.3/927223/eng/202403281 aRhodes, Barbara,d1948-10aComposting our karma :bturning confusion into lessons for awakening our innate wisdom /cBarbara Rhodes ; edited by Elizabeth S.
